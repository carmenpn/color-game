# Color game

A project in which you need to guess the color displayed in the header after the RGB system.

## Instructions

Look how much Red, Green or Blue the winning color has.
Do you know how the RGB system works?
All three of them can be maximum 255. 

So if you have Red with 255 or a value close to it, then that color tends to be more red.
If Green tends to be over 200, then that color is starting to be predominantly green. 
So is for Blue.

But what happens when these values interact with one other? 
What if you have high values for both Red and Green? Or Green and Blue?
Try to guess!
